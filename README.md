# gpt-3-client

A client for OpenAI's GPT-3 API, intended to be used for more _ad hoc_ use cases such as Jupyter/VS Code Notebooks.

In addition to generating text via the API, the client:

- Prints the generated text to console, with a **bolded** prompt.
  - Allows for coloring the text by prediction quality
- Automatically saves each generated text to a file
- Automatically creates a sharable, social-media-optimized image using imgmaker.
